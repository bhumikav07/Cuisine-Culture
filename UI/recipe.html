                        <h5><b>Procedure:</b></h5>
                        <p>To begin making the Smoked Vegetarian Spanish Rice Recipe,heat olive oil in a large pan,
                            saut√© the onions, garlic, green bell pepper, green chillies and celery until they are
                            tender. Saute on low to medium heat so the onions and bell peppers becomes really soft.

                            Once they are softened, add the tomatoes, salt, and pepper saute until the tomatoes have
                            become soft and mushy.

                            Add the rice, corn, peas, salt and pepper and 3 cups of water. Turn the heat to high and
                            bring the rice to a boil. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover the pan and
                            simmer the rice until all the water is completely absorbed. This would take about 15
                            minutes.

                            Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and allow the Spanish Rice to rest for about 15
                            minutes.

                            While the rice is resting, we will proceed to prepare the coal for the coal smoking method.
                            Heat the piece of coal on gas flame until it becomes red hot. Once the coal is hot, place
                            the coal in a steel or a glass cup. Place the cup in the center of the rice dish and press
                            it down, so it rests in the casserole. Pour a teaspoon of ghee or oil over the hot coal. You
                            will notice the coal begins to smoke. Cover the pan immediately, to trap the smoke inside
                            the casserole. The rice will get the smokes flavors as it rests in the smoke. After a couple
                            of minutes, remove the cup of coal (the smoke would have died down).

                            Stir the rice well to combine all the flavors and ingredients after the cooking process and
                            serve.

                            Sprinkle or stir in the cheese to the Smoked Vegetarian Spanish Rice and serve hot along
                            with Pineapple and Cheese Skewers Recipe or Paprika Chicken Skewers Recipe and No Bake White
